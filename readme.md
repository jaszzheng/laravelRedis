## Laravel + Redis

this is a laravel + redis blog application

it simply had implemented a favorite function which user can mark on a article that he/she is keen on and all the favorite articles can be view in the my favorite page.

i also use redis to implemented some real time function, such as the most view articles, show the last article which user had read.
